# An-Exploration-Enhanced-Search-Algorithm-for-Robot-Indoor-Source-Searching

## Source code

The source code will be uploaded after the paper is accepted.

Robot simulations were conducted using the [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/home) simulation environment on the [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) platform. The source search is performed by the [TurtleBot3](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/) Burger robot, equipped with a single-line lidar, MOX concentration sensor, and anemometer.

## Dataset

- [CAD files.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WangHaaa/SourceSearchingDatasetCAD) The 3D models were created by the [RobotAtVirtualHome](https://github.com/DavidFernandezChaves/RobotAtVirtualHome) project and converted into CAD models.
- [CFD data.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WangHaaa/SourceSearchingDatasetCFD) CFD simulations were conducted using the [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org/) 11 software. The solver used is the simpleFOAM solver, and the model used is the $k-\epsilon$ model.
- [Source diffusion simulation data.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WangHaaa/SourceSearchingDatasetGADEN) The diffusion of substances throughout the environment is simulated using [GADEN](https://github.com/MAPIRlab/gaden).
