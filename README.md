## Dataset

Access the datasets via the links below:
- [CAD files.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WangHaaa/SourceSearchingDatasetCAD) The 3D models used in this dataset were created by the [RobotAtVirtualHome](https://github.com/DavidFernandezChaves/RobotAtVirtualHome) project. The 3D models are transformed into CAD models.
- [CFD data.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WangHaaa/SourceSearchingDatasetFOAM) CFD simulations were conducted using the [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org/) 11 software. The solver used is the simpleFOAM solver, and the model used is the $k-\epsilon$ model.
- [Source diffusion simulation data.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WangHaaa/SourceSearchingDatasetGADEN) The diffusion of substances throughout the environment is simulated using [GADEN](https://github.com/MAPIRlab/gaden).
